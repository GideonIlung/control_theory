# Evolution from Model Based to Model Free Control
Implementation & comparision of different control algorithms on OpenAI's cartpole enviroment.

The following Methods were used:
* Proportional Integral Derivative Control (PID)
* Model Predictive Control (MPC)
* Neuroevolution (NE)
* Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)

# Performance of specified control schemes:
For some of the control scheme different optimisers were used.
The following optimisation algorithms where used to find the control response or optimise the Neural Network
* Dynamic Programming (DP)
* Genetic Algorithm (GA)
* Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)
